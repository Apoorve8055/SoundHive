### **1.2 Scope**
The scope of this project includes the development of a web application using the following technologies:

- React.js for front-end development
- Node.js for back-end development
- Firebase for authentication, database and storage management
- WebRTC and socket.io for real-time audio communication
### **1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations**
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
- Firebase: A mobile and web application development platform
- WebRTC: A free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs)
- Socket.io: A JavaScript library for real-time web applications
## **2. Overall Description**
### **2.1 Product Perspective**
SoundHive is a standalone web application that allows users to join virtual spaces where they can communicate with others in real-time through voice chat. The application will be accessible via any modern web browser and will require users to create an account using their email address and name.
### **2.2 Product Features**
The following are the main features of SoundHive:

- Registration: Users can create an account on the platform by providing their email address and name.
- Dashboard: Upon logging in, users are taken to their dashboard where they can see the Broadcasting Now (Active Spaces) section, which shows all the currently active spaces on the platform. Users can see the name of the space, the description, and the number of active participants. They can join any active space by clicking the join button next to the space name.
- Space Creation: Users can create their own spaces by providing a name and description for the space. They can also set a date and time for the space to become active.
- Offline Spaces: This section shows all the spaces that are not currently active but have been created by users. Users can join any offline space by clicking the join button next to the space name.
- Inviting Others: Users can invite others to join their space by sharing a link or sending an email invitation.
- User Profile: Users can view their own profile and update their information, including their name and email address.
- Search: Users can search for spaces based on keywords or topics.
- Mute and Leave: Once users join a space, they have two options - to mute their microphone or to leave the space.
### **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**
The target audience for SoundHive is anyone who wishes to communicate with others in real-time through voice chat. The application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to people of all ages and technical backgrounds.
### **2.4 Operating Environment**
SoundHive will be accessible via any modern web browser on desktop and mobile devices. The application will be hosted on a cloud-based platform.
### **2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**
The design and implementation of SoundHive will be constrained by the following:

- The application must be developed using React.js and Node.js.
- The application must use Firebase for authentication, database and storage management.
- The application must use WebRTC and socket.io for real-time audio communication.
