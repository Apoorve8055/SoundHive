**Module Design**


To design a module for the SoundHive project, we need to identify the components that are necessary to create the application. Based on the requirements listed in the SRS document, the main components for the application are:

1. Front-end development using React.js
1. Back-end development using Node.js
1. Real-time audio communication using WebRTC and socket.io
1. Authentication, database, and storage management using Firebase

The module design should cover these four components and outline how they will work together to create the SoundHive application.

Module 1: Front-end Development using React.js This module will be responsible for creating the user interface of the application. React.js will be used to create the components that will be displayed on the user's screen. The module will handle user interactions with the interface, such as clicking buttons, typing in fields, and selecting options. It will also manage data passed to and from the back-end to update the user interface in real-time.

Module 2: Back-end Development using Node.js This module will be responsible for managing the server-side of the application. It will handle requests from the front-end and process data sent by users. It will communicate with the Firebase database to retrieve and store data. It will also interact with the WebRTC and socket.io modules to manage real-time audio communication between users.

Module 3: Real-time Audio Communication using WebRTC and socket.io This module will be responsible for managing real-time audio communication between users. WebRTC will be used to create peer-to-peer connections between users' browsers to transmit audio data. socket.io will be used to manage the connections between users and handle any errors that may occur during the communication.

Module 4: Authentication, Database, and Storage Management using Firebase This module will be responsible for managing user authentication, database, and storage. Firebase will be used to authenticate users when they log in, store user data, and manage real-time data updates. The module will interact with the back-end module to retrieve and store data from the database.

Overall, these four modules will work together to create the SoundHive application. The front-end module will provide the user interface, the back-end module will manage the server-side of the application, the real-time audio communication module will handle real-time audio communication between users, and the Firebase module will manage user authentication, database, and storage.
