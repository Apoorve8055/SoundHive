**Database Design Document for SoundHive Project**

**Introduction:**

SoundHive is a real-time audio communication platform that allows registered users to create and join virtual chat rooms known as Spaces. Users can communicate with each other through voice chat in real-time. The platform also allows users to invite others to join their Spaces and to view and update their profile information.

**Entities:**

The SoundHive platform consists of four main entities: Users, Spaces, Invitations, and Settings.

1. Users: A registered user of the SoundHive platform.
1. Spaces: A virtual chat room where users can communicate with others in real-time through voice chat.
1. Invitations: A link or email invitation sent by a user to invite others to join their space.
1. Settings: A user's account or the application's settings, such as notification preferences, muted spaces, or app preferences.

**Relationships:**

The following relationships exist between the entities in the SoundHive platform:

- A user can create and join Spaces.
- A Space can have multiple users and Invitations.
- An Invitation is associated with a single Space.

**Schema:**

The SoundHive database schema consists of four tables: Users, Spaces, Invitations, and Settings.

**Users Table:** 

The Users table stores information about the registered users of the SoundHive platform. It includes the following columns:

- user\_id: A unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).
- email: The email address of the user.
- name: The name of the user.
- profile\_data: Any additional profile data related to the user.

**Spaces Table:** 

The Spaces table stores information about each virtual Space, including the name, description, date and time it becomes active, and the number of active participants. It includes the following columns:

- space\_id: A unique identifier for each Space (Primary Key).
- name: The name of the Space.
- description: A brief description of the Space.
- date\_time\_active: The date and time when the Space becomes active.
- num\_active\_participants: The number of active participants in the Space.

**Invitations Table:** 

The Invitations table stores information about Invitations sent by users to others. It includes the following columns:

- invitation\_id: A unique identifier for each Invitation (Primary Key).
- recipient\_email: The email address of the recipient.
- space\_id: The identifier of the Space associated with the Invitation (Foreign Key).
- invitation\_link: A link to the Space associated with the Invitation.

**Settings Table:** 

The Settings table stores settings related to the user's account or the application as a whole, such as notification preferences, muted Spaces, or app preferences. It includes the following columns:

- setting\_id: A unique identifier for each setting (Primary Key).
- user\_id: The identifier of the User associated with the setting (Foreign Key).
- notification\_preferences: The notification preferences of the User.
- muted\_spaces: The muted Spaces of the User.
- app\_preferences: The application preferences of the User.

**Data Flow:**

The following are the data flow steps for the SoundHive project:

1. User Registration: When a user creates an account, their email address and name are stored in the Users table.
1. Space Creation: When a user creates a Space, the Space name, description, and date and time for the Space to become active are stored in the Spaces table.
1. Space Join: When a user joins a Space, a WebRTC connection is established between their device and the other users in the Space. The user's audio stream is sent to the other users, and they receive the audio streams of the other users in the Space.
1. Invitation Sending: When a user sends an Invitation, a unique URL or email message is generated that links to the Space associated with the Invitation. The invitation details are stored in the Invitations table, including the recipient email, the Space identifier, and the invitation link.
1. Profile Update: When a user updates their profile information, the updated data is stored in the Users table.
1. Settings Update: When a user updates their notification preferences, muted Spaces, or app preferences, the updated data is stored in the Settings table, associated with the user's identifier.

**Conclusion:**

The SoundHive database design document outlines the entities, relationships, and schema for the platform. The data flow steps for user registration, Space creation and joining, invitation sending, profile updates, and settings updates are also described. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the SoundHive database structure, allowing developers to efficiently build and maintain the platform.
