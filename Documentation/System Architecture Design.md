**The System Architecture Design for SoundHive**


The System Architecture Design for SoundHive can be broken down into several components that work together to provide users with a seamless audio chat experience. These components include the client-side and server-side architecture, the database schema, and the APIs used for real-time audio communication.

1. Client-Side Architecture: The client-side architecture for SoundHive is built using React.js and is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. The application will be accessible via any modern web browser on desktop and mobile devices.
1. Server-Side Architecture: The server-side architecture for SoundHive is built using Node.js and is responsible for handling user authentication, space creation, space joining, and audio communication. The server will use Firebase for authentication, database and storage management. WebRTC and socket.io will be used for real-time audio communication.
1. Database Schema: The database schema for SoundHive will be built using Firebase Realtime Database, which provides a NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data between clients in real-time. The schema will include user accounts, space information, and audio communication data.
1. APIs: SoundHive will use WebRTC and socket.io for real-time audio communication between users. WebRTC is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). Socket.io is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
1. Integration: All components will be integrated to provide a seamless audio chat experience for the users. The React.js client-side will communicate with the Node.js server-side through APIs, and the server-side will communicate with Firebase Realtime Database and WebRTC/Socket.io APIs to provide real-time audio communication.
1. Deployment: The application will be hosted on a cloud-based platform such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform, which will provide scalability and reliability.
1. Security: User information will be stored securely and protected from unauthorized access using Firebase Authentication. The application will also be secured using HTTPS protocol to encrypt all communications.
